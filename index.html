          <p>Online courses are great and all, but sometimes you just want to be able to flip through a book.</p>
          <p>  I prefer physical books over digital ones, especially if I know I‚Äôll need to go back to and reference it frequently.
            In addition, trying to read code snippets in an eBook on your phone or Kindle simply won‚Äôt do the job.</p>

      <h2>The best books for web development beginners</h2>
      <p>here are my top picks for the best books when you‚Äôre learning web development!</p>

            <h3>HTML & CSS, and JavaScript & JQuery (2 book set) by Jon Duckett</h3>
            <p>Jon Duckett‚Äôs books are incredibly popular, and for good reason‚Äì they explain the topics at hand well and are designed tremendously well.
              They‚Äôre definitely not your usual stuffy programming textbooks! Both these books use graphics to illustrate concepts, and let‚Äôs be honest‚Äì
              they‚Äôll look really cool on your bookshelf üôÇ</p>
            <p>  One note: I‚Äôd go for the hardback versions even though they‚Äôre more expensive‚Äì
               the paperbacks are reported to have bindings that don‚Äôt hold up over time.</p>

            <h3>A two-book set for web </h3>
            <p>There are a lot of JavaScript books out there, and a lot of them are really big. You Don‚Äôt Know JS isn‚Äôt a huge textbook‚Äì
              it‚Äôs a series of six small books, all dedicated to a specific topic in JavaScript.
              There‚Äôs no fluff, just the essential core information.</p>
              <p>These are perfect if you‚Äôre a beginner, because Kyle Simpson does a great job of explaining concepts in a way that‚Äôs easy to understand.
                And the best part is, you can read them all online for free on GitHub! Of course,
                 if you like physical books (which I find handy to have next to the computer) you can order them online.</p>

                <h3>Don‚Äôt Make Me Think by Steve Krug </h3>
                <p>Heard of terms like UX (user experience) or user design, but have no clue what they mean?
                  This book is a great introduction into the world of making websites that people love using.
                   It explains the basics of how visitors to your website behave and what about websites can frustrate them.</p>
                  <p>Bottom line: don‚Äôt design websites that your visitors will hate.</p>

          <h2>Career and Soft Skills</h2>
          <p>These books are not about programming languages per se, but around soft skills, mental focus and productivity.
             These skills are essential in order to succeed in your career, and unfortunately they‚Äôre not always discussed as part of your career development.</p>
             <p>Want to stand out not just as a great programmer,
                but a great employee and an efficient worker? If so, I highly recommend picking up one or more of these books.</p>

              <td><h3>The Clean Coder by Robert Martin</h3> <p> This book has a lot of advice on both coding and succeeding in your career. It‚Äôs written from the perspective of software development,
                but even as a web developer I got a lot of value out of Robert Martin‚Äôs insights.  </p>
                <p>Martin has a ton of valuable suggestions‚Äì from how to conduct yourself as a professional, to learning how to say ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù to simply having a good work ethic.
                  Whether you‚Äôre working currently as a web developer or not, you will learn some great insights on how to excel at your job</p>

                <h3>Deep Work by Cal Newport</h3>
                <p>This book has truly changed the way that I approach work. While most people lead extremely busy lives and constantly try to do and achieve more,
                   Newport has taken the complete opposite approach of ‚Äúless is more.‚Äù</p>
                <p>As the topic of the book implies, he talks a lot about how he personally has developed a practice of ultra-focused deep work over the years (and his accomplishments are quite impressive).
                   Newport also advocates for cutting out elements from your life that don‚Äôt lead you toward your most important goals.</p>
                <p>This book is applicable to web developers and anyone whose work would benefit from long stretches of complete mental focus.
                  I highly, highly recommend it to anyone to read, in any field.</p>

                <h3>The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg</h3>
                <p>The Power of Habit is another book that can be applied to working more efficiently and honestly improving your life habits.
                  Duhigg writes eloquently about how habits (both good and bad) are formed and broken, often without our realization.</p>
                  <p>He uses real world, scientific examples to illustrate these concepts in a very persuasive approach. If you‚Äôre interested in stopping bad habits, picking up good ones, and increasing your willpower
                    (which he argues can be developed like any other skill!) then you‚Äôll likely benefit from this book.</p>
